# First Day Repo

## Description

This first project aimed to create an initial website that included my student profile.  This website provides basic information to my fellow boot camnp students.   It mainly uses HMTL, but for the first time include an external CSS file that I named css.css.  I also included a profile picture with me and my dog Poppy.  I encountered issues around linking CSS attribuites in the HTML index file.  Mainly, I had to learn about CLASSES and ID's.  Classes are used when you want a format to be used in many places on the webiste, vs ID's are used for specific (one-time) use.
